h2. Installation

Installation is simple. Simply clone this repository,

<pre>
  <code>
git clone https://github.com/kenkeiter/void.git
  </code>
</pre>

and move the contents of the included directories in your cloned repository to the directories with corresponding names within Sublime Text 2's @Packages@ directory.

For the uninitiated, you can open this directory by going to @Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Browse Packages...@

After you've moved files to their appropriate directories, you'll need to activate the themes by modifying your configuration.

Under @Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Settings - User@ add the following value in the appropriate way (you know JSON, right?) to activate the new theme:

<pre>
  <code>
"theme": "Void.sublime-theme"
  </code>
</pre>

Save the file. The layout changes should activate. If you run into weird issues, restart Sublime Text 2.

h3. For Best Effect

For the best visual effect (matching the above screenshot), activate the Void color scheme by selecting @Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Color Scheme > Void@. The changes should occur immediately.
